You are assigned to build a fully working, production-level hybrid trading bot designed to operate on the Solana blockchain. This bot should specialize in identifying and trading newly launched meme coins with extremely high prediction accuracy, targeting 80% to 100%. It must combine multiple algorithmic strategies, real-time data feeds, and an intelligent centralized neural control system. The bot will be deployed to Railway (cloud environment) and is expected to run 24/7.

Important Requirements:

No example code or placeholders. Write full implementations of all required components, ready to be executed without modification.

Code must be complete and production-ready. Include actual logic, proper error handling, input validation, logging, and comments where necessary.

All code must be structured into appropriate Python modules. Maintain clarity between responsibilities (data handling, logic, API interactions, orchestration, etc.).

Use only real Python code. Avoid "TODO" notes or incomplete function definitions.

Assume cloud deployment. The bot will be deployed to Railway, so code must include runtime scripts, environment variable support, and stable operation over long durations.

Core Functionalities:

Monitor newly created meme coins on the Solana blockchain in real-time.

Predict short-term price direction (increase or decrease) using multiple analytical layers.

Execute trades or send actionable alerts based on high-confidence decisions.

Algorithmic Components Required:

RSI, EMA, MACD hybrid analysis

Fibonacci retracement calculation for support/resistance detection

Whale wallet monitoring (track inflows/outflows of large holders)

Twitter sentiment analysis using NLP

Influencer activity monitoring (specific accounts and volume patterns)

Price and volume spike detection

Rug pull and scam detection using contract and LP analysis

Liquidity filtering to avoid illiquid tokens

Neural Coordination System:

A central decision-making module that receives signals from all algorithms

Tracks and logs performance of each strategy over time

Dynamically adjusts the weight (trust level) of each strategy based on past success

Makes final decisions based on weighted consensus

Allows inter-algorithm communication if needed (e.g., MACD informing volume analysis)

Twitter Integration:

Collect real-time tweets via Twitter API or scraping tools

Perform sentiment analysis to detect FOMO/FUD using pre-trained transformer models

Monitor engagement spikes, token mentions, and pump signals

Wallet Tracking System:

Track whale wallets on Solana

Identify suspicious wallet behavior such as massive token inflow or liquidity pulls

Recognize dev wallet activity and LP unlocks

Risk Management and Trade Safety:

Avoid newly launched tokens with suspicious contracts (honeypots, blacklist traps)

Implement a smart liquidity threshold mechanism

Limit position sizes and define stop-loss levels

Notification and Logging:

Provide real-time alerts via Telegram or Discord bot

Log every decision, prediction, action, and error with timestamped entries

Optionally include a live web dashboard (e.g., Flask or Streamlit) for human supervision

Deployment Considerations:

Designed to be deployed on Railway cloud platform

Uses environment variables for sensitive configurations (use dotenv or equivalent)

Must include a main script to start all services, with persistent background execution

Should support both learning (passive observation) and trading (live execution) modes

Additional Features to Include:

Algorithm performance learning: continuously update each algorithmâ€™s trust weight

Shadow trading mode: simulate trades without executing, for offline model learning

Smart inter-algorithm communication system

Advanced anti-rug and anti-scam detection layer

Optional reinforcement learning module to refine decisions over time

Build this system as if it will be used by professionals for real-world, automated, high-accuracy crypto trading. Ensure all modules and scripts are operational, logically clean, and properly separated. The final result should be ready for immediate deployment to a cloud platform.
